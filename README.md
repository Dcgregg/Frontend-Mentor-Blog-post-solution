### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned how to properly center a flexbox in the center of the screen, something that I have struggled with for a while now.
I learned how to better space items out, by using dev tools. 

### Continued development

It took me around a week of issues with flexbox and the content wrapper and to get them center on the screen. I will continue to read more about flexbox and then move onto Grid. I want to be comfortable using CSS before continuing with Bootstrap and other frameworks.


### Useful resources

- [Josh Come au](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/) - This helped beforehand, which helped me learn how to center a flexbox.
- [QuackIT](https://www.quackit.com/css/flexbox/tutorial/create_a_website_layout_with_flexbox.cfm) - This helped me learn about the height of a flexbox and other useful information.
